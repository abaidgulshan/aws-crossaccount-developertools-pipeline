To connect a new or existing pipeline in AWS CodePipeline with GitLab.com, first authorize the AWS connection to use your GitLab account.

* Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and open the [AWS Developer Tools console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections).
* Select **Settings** > **Connections** > **Create connection**.
* In Select a **provider**, select **GitLab**.
* In **Connection name**, enter the name for the connection that you want to create and select **Connect to GitLab**.
* In the GitLab **sign-in** page, enter your credentials and select Sign in.
* An authorization page displays with a message requesting authorization for the connection to access your GitLab account. Select **Authorize**.
* The browser returns to the connections console page. In the **Create GitLab connection** section, the new connection is shown in **Connection name**.
* Select **Connect to GitLab**. After the connection is created successfully, a success banner displays. The connection details are shown on the **Connection settings** page.
